This repository exists to provide a place for documentation and utilities required to maintain our on-premises chef infrastructure.

[Wiki Documentation of on-premises Chef infrastructure](http://wiki.marchex.com/index.php/On-Premises_Chef_Server)


Assumptions made in this document:
* You have access to the SSH keys required to access the on-premises chef servers
* You have sudo access on the on-premises chef servers
* You have the AWS CLI installed and configured, and the propers AWS permissions to interact with chef AWS entities (instances, ELBs, etc.)

# Creating a QA stack (or replacement/additional production stack) from running servers

## Creating AMIs from running instances

1. For each server, e.g. `qa-chefserver1.aws-us-west-2-vpc4.marchex.com`, find its instance ID, and create a new AMI from it:

**This will _REBOOT_ the target instance as part of the AMI creation**
```
HOST=qa-chefserver1.aws-us-west-2-vpc4.marchex.com
INSTANCE_ID=`aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-west-2 --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId' --output text --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=$HOST"`
# Create and tag AMI
AMI_ID=`aws ec2 create-image --region us-west-2 --output text --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID --description "Image created from $HOST" --name "chef-server-qa-$(date +%F)"`
aws ec2 create-tags --region us-west-2 --resources $AMI_ID --tags Key=creator,Value="$USER" Key=project,Value='Chef' Key=team,Value='Tools' Key=Name,Value="chef-server-qa-$(date +%F)"
```

2. Repeat for all of the chef server types (currently: chef server and supermarket, replacing HOST with their hostname)

## Launching instances from new AMIs

1. SSH to `vmbuilder1.sea1`
2. Update the `~/autobot-manifests/manifests/chef/hosts.yml` file and update the `image:` value with the correct AMI for each server type.
3. Optionally, destroy existing instances:
    * **This will _TERMINATE_ running instances, if they exist**
    * `autobot -s chef -x chef,pulley -p destroy`
4. Create the new servers with the new AMIs: `autobot -s chef -x chef,pulley`

## Adjusting configuration on the new chef servers

Unless you are bringing up hosts with the same hostname (and using the same ELBs), you will need to make configuration changes on the instances created from those AMIs in order to get them to work.

For example, if you're creating `qa-{chef,supermarket}.marchex.com` from AMIs generated from servers configured to live on `{chef,supermarket}.marchex.com`, you'll want to find all configuration files that might need to be changed.

1. Find configuration files that may need to be changed:
```
# Find all files in /etc/opscode* directories that reference the FQDNs we care about
FQDNS='chef.marchex.com supermarket.marchex.com'
for fqdn in $FQDNS; do
  echo "Looking for $fqdn in chef config files..."
  find $(find /etc/ -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "opscode*") -type f -not -name "*-running.json" -print0 |xargs -0 -I{} grep $fqdn {} /dev/null
done
```
2. Modify these configs and reconfigure services on appropriate servers:
    * chef server
      ```
      sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure

      sudo chef-manage-ctl reconfigure

      sudo opscode-reporting-ctl reconfigure

      sudo opscode-push-jobs-server-ctl reconfigure
      ```
    * supermarket server: `sudo supermarket-ctl reconfigure`

## Placing new instances in service

1. Open the AWS console to the [EC2 > Load Balancers](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#LoadBalancers:) page
2. Select the appropriate ELB that you want to use
3. Click the 'Instances' tab, and select the 'Edit Instances' button
4. Add the approprate instance to the ELB

# Backup and Restore

## Chef server

Based on the [chef-server-ctl documentation here](https://docs.chef.io/server_backup_restore.html#chef-server-ctl)

### Backup -- Chef server
1. SSH to chef server
** This command shuts down the chef server, for up to several minutes -- currently just under 3 minutes as of 2016-08-30**
2. Run `sudo chef-server-ctl backup --yes`

This generates a timestamped tarball in `/var/opt/chef-backup/`, which must be kept safe.

### Restore -- Chef server

1. Start with a tarball generated by the backup step.
** WARNING: This command will overwrite all existing data on a running chef server **
2. Run `sudo chef-server-ctl restore /var/opt/chef-backup/<path-to-desired-backup.tgz>`
3. Reconfigure all services as described at the end of the [Adjusting configuration...](#adjusting-configuration-on-the-new-chef-servers) section.

## Supermarket server

There is currently no supported method to backup/restore a supermarket server. Probably the best bet is to do it via EBS volume backups, and/or snapshotting the running instance.
